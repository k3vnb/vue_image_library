# Vue Image Library

## Description
App for logging in & uploading pictures - Practice with Vue, Vue-router and Vuex, connected to IMGUR API. Based on an excellent tutorial- 'Vue JS Essentials w/ Vuex and Vue Router' by Stephen Grider via Udemy.

It also is used as a testing ground for various plugins and component structures, hence some odd routes and functions which have nothing to do with the core functionality of the Image Library app.


#### Project setup
```
npm install
```
Get a Client Id from Imgur, create a .env file at project root, and add:
exports.apiKey = 'Your Client Id Here';

#### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

#### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

#### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
